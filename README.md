# Building a real-time polls application with Node.js, AngularJS and ~~MongoDB~~ TaffyDB

This application allows you to create polls - and enables users to vote on polls,
with the results updating in real-time. The app accompanies the IBM developerWorks article
[Building a real-time application with Node.js, AngularJS and MongoDB](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-nodejs-polling-app/wa-nodejs-polling-app-pdf.pdf).

I have modified the app to work without MongoDB, and instead use TaffyDB - "The JavaScript Database" 

The app uses the following libraries and frameworks:

* Node.js
* Express
* Jade templates
* ~~Mongoose~~
* TaffyDB
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap 3
* Socket.io

## License

The source code for the app is available under the MIT license, which is found in license.txt in the root
of this repository.
